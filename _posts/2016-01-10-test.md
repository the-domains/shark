Sharks have proven to generate [more money alive than dead][0]

[][0]

for local communities. 

The creation of shark sanctuaries would allow both local human populations and underwater ecosystems to flourish. Over 90% of sharks have died over the last 100 years and many are on the verge of extinction. 

We are hoping to collect signatures from the online community to prove to governments and organizations that there is an actual tangible interest in seeing sharks alive. 

While a dead shark may be worth 100$, a live one, through ecotourism, can bring in[][1]

[up to $1.9 million over the course of their lifetime for an entire community][1]

.

Our first endeavour is to collaborate with David McGuire from [][2]

[Shark Stewards][2]

who are currently championing the creation of a[][3]

shark sanctuary in Sabah and Semporna in Malaysia.

David has successfully implemented a number of policies including the banning of shark finning, and the regulation of the shark fin trade in the USA and the Pacific Rim. 

With your support and signature, we hope that this will be the first of many shark sanctuaries created.

5 shark facts:

1\. Sharks are a keystone species and are responsible for the balance of the underwater ecosystem. They get rid of the sick, dying and diseased while encouraging reproduction amongst fish populations. 

2\. Every year, almost 100 million sharks are killed by humans. That's about 10 million sharks per human. 

3\. Shark fins contain mercury and nearly no nutritional value. They are eaten as a status symbol by the chinese. 

4\. Currently, shark ecotourism brings in $314 million annually worldwide, and is expected to grow 2 fold in the next 20 years.

[][3]

5\. There are over 400 species of sharks, many of which do not harm humans. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/059213dd-f39f-4a1b-b5a1-bf094f63ec18.jpg)
